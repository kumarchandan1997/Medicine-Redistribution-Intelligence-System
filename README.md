# 🏥 Medicine Redistribution Intelligence System (India)

A data-driven healthcare analytics platform to reduce medicine wastage and improve availability across Indian hospitals using **Python, MySQL, Flask, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In India, large quantities of medicines expire every year in hospitals while rural and district hospitals often face shortages of essential drugs.  
This project addresses this critical healthcare logistics problem by building an **intelligent redistribution system** backed by analytics and a live dashboard.

The system:
- Detects expiring medicines
- Predicts demand using consumption data
- Suggests redistribution between nearby hospitals
- Calculates cost savings and patient impact
- Stores results in MySQL
- Visualizes insights via charts and a Flask dashboard

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Reduce medicine wastage before expiry  
- Improve medicine availability in underserved hospitals  
- Provide data-driven insights for government and NGOs  
- Build a scalable, dashboard-ready backend system
