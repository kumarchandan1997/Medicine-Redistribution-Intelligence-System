# 🏥 Medicine Redistribution Intelligence System (India)

AI-driven system to reduce medicine wastage and improve availability across Indian hospitals using Python, Pandas, and MySQL.

---

## 📌 Overview

In India, large quantities of medicines expire every year in hospitals while many rural and district hospitals face shortages of essential drugs.  
This project addresses this critical healthcare logistics problem by intelligently redistributing medicines before expiry.

The system:
- Detects expiring medicines
- Predicts demand using consumption data
- Suggests redistribution between nearby hospitals
- Calculates cost savings and patient impact
- Stores all analytics in MySQL for dashboards and reporting

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Identify medicines nearing expiry
- Reduce wastage and improve utilization
- Support data-driven healthcare decisions
- Build a scalable, government-ready backend system
